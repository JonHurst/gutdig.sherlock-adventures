I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the
excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made
so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little
nervous disturbance in my wife.”

“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”

“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her
back – I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many
have aspired to without success – I can hardly explain it in
any other fashion.”

“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said
Holmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I
have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated
at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the
window?”

“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”

“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you
longer. I shall communicate with you.”

“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,”
said our client, rising.

“I have solved it.”

“Eh? What was that?”

“I say that I have solved it.”

“Where, then, is my wife?”

“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”

Lord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will
take wiser heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing
in a stately, old-fashioned manner, he departed.

“It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honor my head by
putting it on a level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes,
laughing. “I think that I shall have a whiskey-and-soda and
a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my
conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.”

“My dear Holmes!”

“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I
remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination
served to turn my conjecture into a certainty.
