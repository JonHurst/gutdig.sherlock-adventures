and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. I
should not have thought there were so many in the whole
country as were brought together by that single advertisement.
Every shade of color they were – straw, lemon, orange,
brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there
were not many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint.
When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up
in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did
it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted
until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps
which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the
stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected;
but we wedged in as well as we could, and soon found
ourselves in the office.”

“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked
Holmes, as his client paused and refreshed his memory
with a huge pinch of snuff. “Pray continue your very
interesting statement.”

“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden
chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a
head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words
to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed
to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting
a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter,
after all. However, when our turn came, the little man was
much more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he
closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private
word with us.

“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is
willing to fill a vacancy in the League.’

“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered.
‘He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen
anything so fine.’ He took a step backward, cocked his head
on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful.
Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated
me warmly on my success.
