with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-
respect.”

“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”

“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is
grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-
cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number
of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They
all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odor of lime-
cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, gray

“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do
you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?”

“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance;
but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be

with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.
Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you
satisfied?”

“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since,
as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and
