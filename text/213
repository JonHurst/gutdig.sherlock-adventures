slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I
lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in
the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the
herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but
nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go
to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was
daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the ‘Crown Inn,’
which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence
I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing
you and asking your advice.”

“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you
told me all?”

“Yes, all.”

“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your step-
father.”

“Why, what do you mean?”

For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace
which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five
little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were
printed upon the white wrist.

“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.

The lady colored deeply and covered over her injured
wrist. “He is a hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly
knows his own strength.”

There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned
his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling
fire.

“This is a very deep business,” he said, at last. “There
are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I
decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment
to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day,
would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without
the knowledge of your step-father?”

“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon
some most important business. It is probable that he will be
away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you.
