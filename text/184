no harm done, save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be
rather a waste of energy.”

Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the
door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into
the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who
is dazed with astonishment.

“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped.

“Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and
flapped off through the kitchen window?” Holmes twisted
himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man’s
excited face.

“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He
held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm
a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean
in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like
an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.

Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!”
said he, “this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you
know what you have got?”

“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as
though it were putty.”

“It’s more than a precious stone. It is {{the}} precious stone.”

“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I
ejaculated.

“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing
that I have read the advertisement about it in {{The Times}} every
day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be
conjectured, but the reward offered of £1000 is certainly not
within a twentieth part of the market price.”

“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire
plumped down into a chair, and stared from one
to the other of us.

“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there
are sentimental considerations in the background which would
induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could
but recover the gem.”
