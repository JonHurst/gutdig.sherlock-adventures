of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared,
and all was dark again save the single lurid spark
which marked a chink between the stones.

Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a
rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned
over upon its side, and left a square, gaping hole, through
which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there
peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it,
and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself
shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon
the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the
hole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small
like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.

“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and
the bags. Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing
for it!”

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder
by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard
the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts.
The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes’s
hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol
clinked upon the stone floor.

“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes, blandly. “You have
no chance at all.”

“So I see,” the other answered, with the utmost coolness.
“I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got
his coat-tails.”

“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said
Holmes.

“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very
completely. I must compliment you.”

“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea
was very new and effective.”

“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s
quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out
while I fix the derbies.”
