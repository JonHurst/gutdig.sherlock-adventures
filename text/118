presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to
meet him at Boscombe Pool was some one who had been in
Australia.”

“What of the rat, then?”

Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and
flattened it out on the table. “This is a map of the Colony
of Victoria,” he said. “I wired to Bristol for it last night.”
He put his hand over part of the map. “What do you read?”
he asked.

“ARAT,” I read.

“And now?” He raised his hand.

“BALLARAT.”

“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of
which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying
to utter the name of his murderer. So-and-so, of Ballarat.”

“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.

“It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field
down considerably. The possession of a gray garment was a
third point which, granting the son’s statement to be correct,
was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness
to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with
a gray cloak.”

“Certainly.”

“And one who was at home in the district, for the Pool
can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where
strangers could hardly wander.”

“Quite so.”

“Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination
of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that
imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.”

“But how did you gain them?”

“You know my method. It is founded upon the observance
of trifles.”

“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the
length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their
traces.”
