hands – “I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those
poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem
to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which
no foresight and no precautions can guard against.”

“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man,
or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is
no time for despair.”

“I have seen the police.”

“Ah!”

“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced
that the inspector has formed the opinion that the
letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations

Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible
imbecility!” he cried.

“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may

“Has he come with you to-night?”

“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”

Again Holmes raved in the air.

“Why did you come to me?” he said; “and, above all,
why did you not come at once?”

“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major
Prendergast about my troubles, and was advised by him to
come to you.”

“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should
have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose,
than that which you have placed before us – no suggestive
detail which might help us?”

“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged
in his coat pocket, and drawing out a piece of discolored,
blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. “I have
some remembrance,” said he, “that on the day when my uncle
burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins
which lay amid the ashes were of this particular color.
