who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training
entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had
cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream.
These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced
from his hat. Also, by-the-way, that it is extremely
improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”

“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”

“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I
give you these results, you are unable to see how they are
attained?”

that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did

man with so large a brain must have something in it.”

has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less
foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a
weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavored to
conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them
