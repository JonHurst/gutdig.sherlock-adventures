in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting
there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed
vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling
up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon
his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off
to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me
