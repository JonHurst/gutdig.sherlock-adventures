“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.

I took a step forward. In an instant his strange head-gear
began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair
the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome
serpent.

“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest

girl, no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught
a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient
to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim
