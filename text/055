a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls
and a brown board with “{{Jabez Wilson}}” in white letters,
upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed
client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes
stopped in front of it with his head on one side, and looked
it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered
lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down
again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally
he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously
upon the pavement with his stick two or three times,
he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly
opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who
asked him to step in.

“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you
how you would go from here to the Strand.”

“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant, promptly,
closing the door.

“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes, as we walked away.
“He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London,
and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be
third. I have known something of him before.”

“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a
good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am
sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you
might see him.”

“Not him.”

“What then?”

“The knees of his trousers.”

“And what did you see?”

“What I expected to see.”

“Why did you beat the pavement?”

“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for
talk. We are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something
of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts
which lie behind it.”
