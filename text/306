“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her
room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table.
I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that
if she had married my boy all might have been well with him.
Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark
that she refers in this note:

“‘{{My dearest Uncle}}, – I feel that I have brought trouble
upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible
misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought
in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel
that I must leave you for ever. Do not worry about my future,
for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for
me, for it will be fruitless labor and an ill-service to me. In
life or in death, I am ever your loving {{Mary}}.’

“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do
you think it points to suicide?”

“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible
solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the
end of your troubles.”

“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes;
you have learned something! Where are the gems?”

“You would not think £1000 apiece an excessive sum for
them?”

“I would pay ten.”

“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover
the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you
your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for
£4000 pounds.”

With a dazed face the banker made out the required check.
Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular
piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon
the table.

With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.

“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”
