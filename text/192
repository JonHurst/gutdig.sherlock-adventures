arms akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it
straight, now.”

“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold
you the geese which you supplied to the ‘Alpha.’”

“Well, then, I sha’n’t tell you. So now!”

“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know
why you should be so warm over such a trifle.”

“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered
as I am. When I pay good money for a good article
there should be an end of the business; but it’s ‘Where are
the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will
you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only
geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.”

“Well, I have no connection with any other people who
have been making inquiries,” said Holmes, carelessly. “If
you won’t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I’m always
ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a
fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”

“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,”
snapped the salesman.

“It’s nothing of the kind.”

“I say it is.”

“I don’t believe it.”

“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have
handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those
birds that went to the ‘Alpha’ were town bred.”

“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”

“Will you bet, then?”

“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right.
But I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to
be obstinate.”

The salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books,
Bill,” said he.

The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a
great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath
the hanging lamp.
