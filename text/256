“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should
have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the
garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman’s
entreaties.”

“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable
face in my life.”

“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet.
“Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at
what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be
found.”

“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes, quietly.

“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your
opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I
say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.”

“And I say east,” said my patient.

“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There
are several quiet little villages up there.”

“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills
there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage
go up any.”

“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty
diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us.
Who do you give your casting vote to?”

“You are all wrong.”

“But we can’t {{all}} be.”

“Oh yes, you can. This is my point;” he placed his finger
in the centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find
them.”

“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.

“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself
that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in.
How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy
roads?”

“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet,
thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the
nature of this gang.”
