“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could
never tell them apart.’

“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as
my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had
sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to
where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night.
Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks
that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself.
And now – and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever
having touched the wealth for which I sold my character.
God help me! God help me!” He burst into convulsive
sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.

There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing,
and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’s finger-tips
upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and
threw open the door.

“Get out!” said he.

“What, sir! Oh, heaven bless you!”

“No more words. Get out!”

And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a
clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle
of running footfalls from the street.

“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand
for his clay pipe, “I am not retained by the police to supply
their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another
thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and
the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a
felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This
fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.
Send him to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life.
Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in
our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution
is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to
touch the bell, doctor, we will begin another investigation, in
which, also, a bird will be the chief feature.”
