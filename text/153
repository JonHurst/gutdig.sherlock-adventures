pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me,
and then look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly
upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come

Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically
accomplished, and for the rest, I could not wish anything
better than to be associated with my friend in one of
those singular adventures which were the normal condition of
his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid
