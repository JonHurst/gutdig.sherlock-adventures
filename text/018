opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He
carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across
the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones,
a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted
that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he
entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be
a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a
long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the
length of obstinacy.

“You had my note?” he asked, with a deep harsh voice
and a strongly marked German accent. “I told you that I
would call.” He looked from one to the other of us, as if
uncertain which to address.

“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and
colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to
help me in my cases. Whom have I the honor to address?”

“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian
nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your
friend, is a man of honor and discretion, whom I may trust
with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I
should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed
me back into my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he.
“You may say before this gentleman anything which you may
say to me.”

The count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must
begin,” said he, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for
two years, at the end of that time the matter will be of no
importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of
such weight it may have an influence upon European history.”

“I promise,” said Holmes.

“And I.”

“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor.
“The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be
unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by
which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.”
