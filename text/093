THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY

{{We}} were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife
and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It
was from Sherlock Holmes, and ran in this way:

“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have
just been wired for from the West of England in connection
with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will
come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington
by the 11.15.”

“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at
me. “Will you go?”

“I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list
at present.”

“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have
been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change
would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr.
Sherlock Holmes’s cases.”

“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained
through one of them,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I
must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.”

My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had
the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My
wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time
stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington
Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down
the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and
taller by his long gray travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth
cap.
